## 2. Difficulties

Overall, I had little to no difficulty understanding the material! Material was explained pretty well and I especially enjoyed the guest lectures covering different sub-fields of NLP!

## 4. Thank You

I always put these notes at the end of any project (lecture watching included!). Compared to the RL lecture series, this one was a lot more understandable. Both were great, nonetheless. I really enjoyed learning about the popular LLMs of today like BERT and the BERT family (really liked ELMo and ERNIE, they should also have big bird ðŸ˜‚). Properties in the LLMs like analogy completion, in-context learning, and closed-book knowledge were fascinating to me. I'd like to thank Professor Manning and everyone responsible for making this lecture series possible. And I'd also like to thank you for reading this preface! Have a wonderful day.
